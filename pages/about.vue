      <p class="text-gray-700 text-md leading-relaxed">I’m a creator, a builder, a fixer, a curious person with too many notebooks, and someone who genuinely loves getting complicated digital things to actually work. </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-md leading-relaxed mt-4"> I’ve spent over a decade creating and supporting tools from idea, to inception, until EOL (sometimes, sadly) - for government and military teams, managing projects end-to-end, and figuring out how to bridge the gap between ideas and execution. I care about systems that scale, apps that feel good to use, and making things people don’t need a training session to understand. </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-md leading-relaxed mt-4">Whether I'm writing code, leading delivery, or sketching workflows in a coffee-stained notebook, I’m always thinking about people first — and how to make their experience smoother, smarter, and more real.</p>

        <div>
          <p> I take messy, half-shaped ideas and turn them into structured, scoped, ready-to-build plans. Sometimes that means writing code. Sometimes that means writing 40 sticky notes. Most days it means navigating humans, not just tech.</p>
          <p class="mt-4"> I’ve worked with military teams, government departments, and public sector orgs where success means balancing legacy systems, security constraints, and real people trying to get real things done. That’s my comfort zone.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p> I lead small, adaptable teams. I scope what matters. I build workflows that move things forward without turning everything into a ceremony. If there's ambiguity, I make it actionable. If there's conflict, I listen, then translate.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">Strategy is great. But delivery is where the trust is built. I care about getting the thing into the world — tested, improved, and used by the people it was made for.

          <p>I'm obsessed with thrifting and fashion flips. Clothes should reflect who you are and where you're going. Also I firmly believe that every dress deserves pockets, and every outfit should feel like a little bit of rebellion and a little bit of armour.
